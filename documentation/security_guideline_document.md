## Security and Best Practices

Following security-by-design principles is paramount. Key measures include:

- **Authentication & Access Control:**
  - Implement robust authentication and RBAC.
  - Enforce strong password policies and secure session management with tokens.
  - Utilize MFA for sensitive operations.

- **Input Validation & Output Encoding:**
  - Use parameterized queries and input sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
  - Implement context-aware output encoding to mitigate XSS.

- **Data Protection:**
  - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
  - Secure management of secrets using dedicated tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).

- **API & Service Security:**
  - Mandate HTTPS for all communications, enable rate limiting, and configure CORS restrictively.
  - Validate and sanitize all API inputs and outputs.

- **Infrastructure & Configuration:**
  - Secure server configurations, restrict file and service access, and disable debug modes in production.
  - Keep all software and dependencies up to date.

- **Dependency Management:**
  - Regularly scan and update dependencies. Use lockfiles to ensure reproducible builds.
