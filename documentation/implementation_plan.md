3. **Project Repository Initialization**: If starting fresh, initialize a new Git repository for the project. (Reference: Project Overview)

4. **Next.js 14 Project Setup**: Create a new Next.js project using Next.js 14 (exact version as specified, since Next.js 14 is tailored for current AI coding tools). Run the command:
   
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@14 --typescript
   ```
   (Reference: Tech Stack: Frontend)

5. **Tailwind CSS & shadcn Integration**: Inside the project directory, install and configure Tailwind CSS and shadcn UI components. Create configuration files (`tailwind.config.js` and required shadcn configs) in the root directory. (Reference: Tech Stack: Frontend, UI/UX)

6. **Windsurf MCP Configuration for Supabase**: 
   a. Open the Cascade assistant in Windsurf.
   b. Click on the hammer (MCP) icon and select **Configure** to open the configuration file.
   c. Add the following configuration for macOS:
      ```json
      { "mcpServers": { "supabase": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres", "<connection-string>"] } } }
      ```
      and for Windows:
      ```json
      { "mcpServers": { "supabase": { "command": "cmd", "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres", "<connection-string>"] } } }
      ```
   d. Display the following link so the user can retrieve the connection string: 
      [Supabase MCP Connection Guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/mcp#connect-to-supabase-using-mcp).
   e. After the connection string is obtained, replace `<connection-string>` in the configuration file accordingly.
   f. Save the configuration file and tap **Refresh** in the Cascade assistant to confirm the MCP server shows a green active status. (Reference: Tech Stack: Tools - Windsurf)

## Phase 3: Backend Development

13. **Initialize Supabase Project**: Initiate a new Supabase project for backend services. (Reference: Tech Stack: Backend)

14. **Configure Supabase Auth & Storage**: Set up Supabase authentication (for managing user sessions and 2FA) and storage for file assets. (Reference: Data Privacy & Security)

15. **Database Schema Design**: Define the PostgreSQL schema to include the following tables: 
    - users
    - tasks
    - habits
    - projects
    - goals
    - finances
    - journals

    Include necessary relations and indexes. Write the SQL migration files under `/supabase/migrations/`. (Reference: Core Features, Data Privacy)

16. **MCP Table Creation**: Use the Supabase MCP server (configured in Phase 1) to execute the migration scripts and create the required tables. (Reference: Tech Stack: Backend, Windsurf MCP Configuration)

17. **Implement REST API Endpoints**: Create API routes (e.g., using Next.js API routes under `/pages/api/`) for key functionalities such as:
    - Creating and managing tasks (`POST /api/tasks`, `GET /api/tasks`)
    - Updating habit progress (`PATCH /api/habits`)
    - Managing projects and goals (`POST /api/projects`, `GET /api/projects`)
    - Financial management endpoints (`POST /api/finances`, etc.)
    (Reference: Core Features)

18. **SEO & Security Middleware**: In the API endpoints, integrate CORS and security headers. Use Supabase and Next.js middleware to enforce 2FA and encryption where applicable. (Reference: Data Privacy & Security)

19. **Stripe and PayPal Integration Setup**: 
    a. Create a file at `/backend/payment/stripeConfig.js` and another one for PayPal integration to handle payment processing.
    b. Setup webhook endpoints for Stripe and PayPal events under `/pages/api/payments/webhook.ts`.
    (Reference: Core Features: Monetization)

20. **Integration with Third-Party Services**: 
    a. For Google Calendar integration, create an API endpoint `/api/integrations/calendar` that handles OAuth and synchronization tasks.
    b. For Plaid financial data integration, create an endpoint `/api/integrations/plaid` to securely fetch and manage financial data.
    (Reference: Core Features: Third-Party Integrations)
